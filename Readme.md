# Data Grid for Windows Forms - How to enable the auto height feature for column headers

The 14.1.3+ branch has no code sample since Data Grid now has the [GridView.OptionsView.ColumnHeaderAutoHeight](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/DevExpress.XtraGrid.Views.Grid.GridOptionsView.ColumnHeaderAutoHeight) property. Enable this property 
to wrap column captions in a [Grid Control](https://docs.devexpress.com/WindowsForms/3455/controls-and-libraries/data-grid), and automatically adjust the height of the column header panel.

Switch to the 9.2.11+ branch to view a custom solution for older versions, before the `ColumnHeaderAutoHeight` property was implemented.
